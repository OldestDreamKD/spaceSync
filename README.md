WorkspaceMapper is a workspace visualization and management web application that enables users to map, allocate, and manage workspaces efficiently. This project was developed to provide a digital solution for workspace organization, allowing users to interact with workspace layouts dynamically.

Current Features
Interactive workspace mapping

Dynamic resource allocation (desks, rooms, etc.)

Real-time updates on available spaces

User-friendly interface for easy navigation

Future Enhancements
I aim to enhance the project by integrating database storage, user authentication, and role-based access control, making it a fully functional workspace management system.
